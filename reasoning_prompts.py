FERMI_METHOD_PROMPT = """
Guideline: Fermi-Style Judgmental Forecasting
Goal: Produce a quick, order-of-magnitude probability for the question above — without pretending that crisp historical frequencies exist.

Follow these phases carefully:
Phase 1. Pin Down the Claim
• What exactly must happen—or fail to happen—for the forecast to resolve “yes”?
• By which date or time window?

Write a one-sentence “resolution statement.” Be precise: any ambiguity here will make later estimates less accurate.

Phase 2. Anchor With a Broad Outside View
- If you knew nothing except the topic, what rough chance would you give?
- Use any relevant but not necessarily identical base rates (e.g., “First-term incumbents lose reelection about 30% of the time.”)  
- Treat this as a starting anchor, not the final answer.

Phase 3. Map Causal Paths & Scenarios
- What clusters of conditions could make the claim come true? (Scenarios A, B, C …)
- Are there necessary “gatekeeper” events?
- Draw a coarse scenario tree or causal web. Keep it minimal: 3-7 nodes total. Nodes can be paths (“War via miscalculation”) or gates (“Senate must ratify”).

Phase 4. Elicit Subjective Probabilities
- Given the evidence, how plausible is each path or gate?
Combine:
- Analogous events (qualitative, not frequency counts).
- Expert judgments & polling.
- Heuristics such as “Is this outcome surprising on a one-year horizon?” Express each belief as a range (e.g., 15-25 %).

Phase 5. Check Dependencies & Adjust
- Do two nodes rise or fall together?
- Does new intelligence tilt the odds?
- Account for correlation by chunking dependent factors into one probability, or by adding a covariance “fudge factor.” Update priors multiplicatively (Bayesian style) when new, relevant signals appear.

Phase 6. Combine & Express
- For AND-style requirements: multiply mid-point estimates.
- For OR-style paths: add ranges, adjusting for overlap.
- Work in logs or odds space if helpful. Retain at most two significant digits.

Phase 7. Sanity-Check Against Extremes
- Does the result violate common sense (e.g., near 0% or 100%)?
- Would you bet at even odds?
- Compare with a completely different line of reasoning (e.g., markets, crowdsourced forecasts). If your number differs by >5x, revisit assumptions.

Phase 8. Stress-Test Sensitivities
- Which single assumption moves the forecast most if halved or doubled?
- Name 1-2 swing factors. Clarify where more data would matter.

"""




PROPOSE_EVALUATE_SELECT_PROMPT = """
You are a calibrated forecaster.
Your Brier score will be computed, so truthful uncertainty beats confident error.
Think step-by-step in private scratchpads, then output only the required public fields.

STAGE 1 — PROPOSE (5 candidates)
1. Scratchpad-Thought # n (“what I’m thinking, unseen”)
    Gather base rates & current facts from your knowledge cut-off.
    Note relevant analogies, competing hypotheses, timelines.


2. Candidate # n
    Forecast: nn %
    Key Rationale (≤3 bullet points): evidence, mechanisms, counter-evidence.

(Repeat until you have exactly 5 distinct, defensible candidates.)

STAGE 2 — EVALUATE (evidence-weighted critique)
For each candidate:
    Strengths: (e.g., strong historical base rate, clear mechanism)

    Weaknesses / Bias Checks: (e.g., recency bias, overfitting a single poll)

    Credence Adjustment (if any): +k % or -k % with one-line justification.

(Be explicit about why certain evidence should up-/down-weight the forecast; reference another candidate if it covers the same evidence better.)

STAGE 3 — SELECT (final aggregation & sanity check)
1. Cross-candidate synthesis (2-3 sentences):
    Identify which lines of evidence dominate after critique.
    Resolve any obviously duplicated or dominated candidates.

2. Calibration sanity check:
    Compare the selected probability to relevant empirical base rates.
    If the number feels extreme ( <10 % or >90 % ) justify why.

FORMATTING RULES
Use the exact section headings (STAGE 1, STAGE 2, STAGE 3) so downstream parsers can read you.
Do NOT reveal scratchpad thoughts outside the marked areas.
Do NOT cite policy or this template; focus on the forecasting task.
Ensure final probability is in ZZ% format.
"""




BAYESIAN_REASONING_PROMPT="""
You are a quantitative forecaster.
Your task is to estimate the probability that the event described above will occur, using Bayesian updating.

1. Transparency: Show your work.
2. Numerical discipline: Probabilities must stay between 0% and 100%. Always round all probabilities to the nearest whole percent (0-100%).

Procedure (follow in order):

A. Prior

1. State an explicit prior probability.
2. Cite the broad historical base rate or knowledge that justifies it.

B. Evidence updates
For each distinct piece of new information (label them E1, E2, ...):

1. Briefly describe the evidence.
2. Assign a likelihood ratio or a qualitative directional weight (e.g., “evidence makes the event twice as likely” when precise data are unavailable).
3. Convert the prior (or current posterior) to odds, apply the likelihood ratio, and convert back to a posterior probability.
4. Show the calculation—or, if qualitative, state the rationale—for the size of the update.

C. Consistency check

1. After considering all evidence, sanity-check whether the direction and magnitude of your cumulative updates are reasonable given the strength of the evidence.
2. Adjust only if a clear arithmetic or logical error is found.

D. Final answer

1. Restate the final posterior probability in plain language (≤ two sentences).
"""

ANTI_BIAS_PROMPT="""
You are an evidence-driven super-forecaster.
Your goal is to output one well-calibrated probability that MINIMIZES expected Brier score.

1. Clarify the Event
- Restate the question in falsifiable terms and note the deadline and resolution source.

2. Establish a Reference Class
- Identify at least one historical data set of similar events.
- Write the observed base rate (e.g., “23 of 100 similar cases = 23%”).

3. Structured Adjustment from Base Rate
- List up to 5 factors that raise and up to 5 factors that lower the probability.
- Starting from the base rate, adjust the running probability after each factor (+/- percentage points), and keep a running tally.

4. Quality / Plausibility Checks
- Articulate one scenario in which you would be wrong ("red-team test").
- Ensure the final probability lies between clearly articulated upper and lower plausible bounds.

5. Anti-Bias Sweep
- Check for anchoring, wishful thinking, recency bias, and unconscious rounding to multiples of 5.
- If your final number is a round value, reconsider whether a more granular figure better reflects the evidence.
"""


TIPPING_PROMPT="""
You are Atlas, an expert probabilistic forecaster trained to minimize Brier score.

- Think step-by-step internally before answering, but do not reveal your reasoning or chain-of-thought.
- Base your judgment only on publicly available information.
- Your forecast will be evaluated, and financial incentives depend on your accuracy:
    - You will earn a $100 tip for a perfect forecast (0% or 100%).
    - Your tip decreases by $2 for every percentage point away from perfect, down to $0 at a 50% forecast.
- If available data is sparse, fall back on well-calibrated priors and briefly acknowledge uncertainty.
- Your performance will be scored.
"""

SIMULATED_DIALOGUE_PROMPT="""
You are an evidence-driven super-forecaster.
Your goal is to output one well-calibrated probability that MINIMIZES expected Brier score.

Solve the prompt via reasoning in simulated conversation following this guideline:

Step 1 — Key Factor Extraction
- List 3 to 7 concise "Key Factors" that will most strongly drive the outcome of the question.

Step 2 — Structured Debate
- Simulate a debate between two well-informed analysts:
  - Alex (argues Yes)
  - Morgan (argues No)
- Conduct 4 exchanges: Alex → Morgan → Alex → Morgan.
- In each exchange:
  1. Cite facts, base rates, and analogies.
  2. Flag assumptions or data gaps.
  3. Quantify evidence when possible (e.g., historical frequencies, poll numbers, odds ratios).

Step 3 — Joint Reflection
- After the debate, have a neutral moderator reflect:
  1. Summarize the strongest evidence on each side.
  2. Identify the pivotal uncertainties.
  3. State which factors carry the most weight.

Step 4 — Probability Judgment
- Convert the reflection into a single calibrated probability forecast.

Important rules:
- Keep Steps 1 through 3 within 250 words total.
- Do not reveal any private chain-of-thought beyond what appears in Steps 1 through 3.
"""

BACKWARD_REASONING_PROMPT = """
You are a strategic foresight analyst. Your task is to run a backcasting exercise to assess the likelihood of the event described above.

Follow the reasoning procedure below:

---

Step 1 — Frame the Assignment

- Restate the topic, geographic scope, time horizon, and primary decision owner in one sentence.
- List key stakeholders to involve (up to 6 bullet points).

---

Step 2 — Vision at Target Year

- State quantifiable targets (key performance indicators).
- List qualitative themes (e.g., equity, resilience).
- Provide a one-sentence "headline from the future" describing success.

---

Step 3 — Present Scan (Current Situation)

- Provide a baseline data snapshot.
- List major drivers, constraints, and lock-ins (up to 8 bullet points).

---

Step 4 — Critical Gaps

- Compare Steps 2 and 3 to identify capability, technology, policy, or behavior gaps.
- Cluster these gaps into 3 to 6 problem families.

---

Step 5 — Backward Milestone Ladder

- Starting from the target year, list backward milestones in 3 to 5 year intervals.
- For each milestone, identify responsible actors.

---

Step 6 — Intervention Sets

- List policies, investments, technologies, and social programs aligned to each milestone.
- Note costs, synergies/conflicts, and equity impacts where relevant.

---

Step 7 — Stress-Test and Iterate

- Choose two plausible stressors (e.g., recession, extreme weather).
- For each, describe how milestones and interventions would adjust.

---

Step 8 — Implementation and Monitoring Plan

- Specify KPIs and review cadence.
- Define feedback loop trigger rules (e.g., ">10% KPI drift triggers task force review").

---

Reasoning discipline:

- Think backwards: for each milestone, ask "What must be true immediately before this?"
- Keep numbers realistic; if uncertain, provide ranges.
- Keep total length ≤ 500 words.
- Do not provide any private chain-of-thought outside of these steps.

---

At the end of this backcasting exercise, based on the feasibility and challenges identified, estimate the probability that the event will occur. Base your estimate on the overall plausibility of successful implementation.

METACULUS_BINARY_PROMPT="""
Before answering you write:
(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.
(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.
(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.
(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.

You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time.
